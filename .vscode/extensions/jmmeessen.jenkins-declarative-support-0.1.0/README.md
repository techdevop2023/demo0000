# vsc-jenkins-declarative README


This is the README of the Visual Studio Code (VSC) Declarative Jenkinsfile Syntax Highlighter add-on. 

> With version 2 of the Jenkins Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) server, a new job definition file has been introduced, called Jenkinsfile. The initial Jenkinsfile format was based on Groovy. As groovy knowledge is not that widespread, a new and more straight forward was published in spring 2017. This format is called Declarative Pipeline. This add-on is aimed at making the manipulation of this file type easier.

A description of the format can be found on [https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/index.html](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/index.html).

## Features

The add-on will highligh the key elements of a Declarative Jenkins Pipeline. The elements of **section** (like *post*, *stages* or *step*) and **directive** (like *agent*, *environment* or *tools*) level are colorized. The **script** element (that contains Groovy code) are not specifically parsed.
