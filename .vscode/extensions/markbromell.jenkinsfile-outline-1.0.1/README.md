# Outline for Jenkinsfile groovy pipelines

This can be used for quick and easy navigation throughout your pipelines, it populates the built-in VS Code Outline panel.

If you already have a groovy plugin that populates the Outline panel, this may interfere with that, but if you mainly work with Jenkinsfile's then this is perfect for you.
